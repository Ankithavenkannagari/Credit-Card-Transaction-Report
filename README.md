## 🔍 Process  

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values and inconsistent formats.  
   - Standardized transaction categories and customer details.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Investigated spending behaviors across **categories, time periods, and demographics**.  
   - Applied **statistical techniques** for anomaly detection.  

3. **Visualization in Power BI**  
   - Designed dashboards to track **KPIs**: total spend, category-wise trends, high-value customers, and fraud indicators.  

4. **Insights & Storytelling**  
   - Segmented customers by **spending habits**.  
   - Highlighted **seasonal trends** (festive, holiday spikes).  
   - Flagged potential **fraudulent transactions**.
